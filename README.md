# Staff Directory with optional department dropdown and advanced query

## Summary

This code is forked from the great work of [this repository](https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-people-directory). Thank you to developers Jo√£o Mendes, Peter Paul Kirschner, and Sudharsan K.

This web part searches the organizational directory and has letter filters. You can optionally set up department names and add a dropdown list to filter by department.

The web part is built with SPFx, ReactJS, and Microsoft Fabric UI.
